# Javascript Projects
### The majority of the content in this repository was created to test out different javascript scripts and in that way is a bit nonsensical. There are some projects that could be highlighted for those interested:

## Calculator
No explanation to this really necessary besides all coding and color coordination was done by me while doing my Tech Academy exercises.

## Pizza Project
This site is made to replicate a "customer order" scenario at a pizza shop. Not very complicated but still utilizes stored prices to display total of order.

## TicTacToe
Again, not much explanation needed, same as the calculator, but a fun little side project nonetheless.
